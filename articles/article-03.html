              This semester has been a bit of overkill with all of my courses stacking up projects upon one another. So I haven't had as much time to deep dive into the topics like I would like to. For this assignment in my Web Development class I was given the task of creating a project that demonstrates my knowledge of HTML's canvas. To create a project on my own from scratch I know I wouldn't be able to create anything noteworthy or something I could truly learn from within a limited amount of time. I chose to follow along a 2 hr video implementation of a Space Invaders game. However the time it actually took me to code the game was somewhere closer to 8 hours. I wanted to fully understand the thought process behind why he was doing what he was doing, and how he was doing it. I was able to achieve a better understanding of how to query elements from the HTML file, and then use JavaScripts innerHTML to update the canvas. This project really gave me a glimpse of how powerful JavaScript actually is. I'm definitely going to look further into canvas's 2d capablities following this project. Some features I may want to implement on my own include adding sound and a highscores leaderboard to the game.
