              During my first semester of senior year, I took a course in Cloud Computing. That class was very interesting, and challenging for me at the same time due to my limited knowledge in Python. For my first major assignment I was given the task of having to place a stock's historical data into a S3 bucket, and then have a lambda function trigger once that file was uploaded into the bucket. From there my lambda was to perform calculations on that file, and use AWS's SNS feature to trigger another lambda function which places the re-configured file into another S3 bucket with the results. I was only able to complete 75% of the project, and it was one of the most challenging projects I've had throughout my CS journey in college. However after having taken a class in Python, I feel like I am ready to take on the challenge of completing the project to 100%. I've also purchased two courses on UDEMY to help me study for the AWS certifications, and further my knowledge in Cloud Computing. All in all I look forward to the challenge of retackling the assignment I thought was impossible.
