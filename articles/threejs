When creating this portfolio I came across some interesting videos on Youtube that have peaked my interest for future projects. The most impressive resumes I came across were all done in a JavaScript library called Three.js. Three.js is used to create and display 3D computer graphics in a web browser. One portfolio in particular was next level to me, and pretty much opened my eyes to how powerful JavaScript really is. This guy he created a portfolio based around a ramen shop design that gave you a clear picture of what type of person he was. To be able to have so much expression with so little was so cool to me. For my future implementation of my portfolio I would like to do something similar, and do a Toonami themed portfolio. There is a course by a guy who is an expert in Three.js named Bruno Simon that I plan on doing over summer break.
