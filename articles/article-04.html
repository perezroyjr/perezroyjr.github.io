                    <h6>Project Idea:</h6>
                    <p>
                        For my project idea I was thinking of things I would find useful in the moment. One thing I thought about was how I need to practice coding and improve for interviews. Leetcode is an obvious option when it comes to doing so, however then I thought about what about the whiteboard portion of the interview. So, I was thinking maybe thereâ€™s a way I can combine the two. So, for my project my goal is to create something that combines the two. I was thinking something along the lines of whiteboard.io or such.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Abstract:</h6>
                    <p>
                        When searching YouTube and watching many interviews, I see employers ask their interviewee to solve a task using only the whiteboard. The most viewed one is a google interview where he walks through his steps using only the whiteboard and a marker. The target audience would be those who have some sort of touchscreen capability with a pen and would like to write their leetcode solutions by hand to the screen. The app will be very barebones since Iâ€™m still learning web development, and all that entails. I also plan on doing the project alone that way I can learn a bit of everything. 
                        
                        The way I plan on achieving this is by using a leetcode questions scraper, combined with a drawable canvas, and then displaying the two to an html page. I would also like to scrape the top three YouTube solution videos for the question to be used as a resource if the person attempting the problem is stuck or doesnâ€™t know how to solve it. I havenâ€™t quite thought of how I can implement a database into it. I was thinking maybe the user will be able to save their current state or implement a way for them to save their solutions and come back to them later.    
                    </p>
                    <h6>Team:</h6>
                    <p>
                       For the team I would like to do it solo just so I can learn as much as possible in the short time available. However, I do have 3 other senior level CS classes so I canâ€™t promise it will be the prettiest app. This is something Iâ€™d like to continue working on post semester. ðŸ˜Š
